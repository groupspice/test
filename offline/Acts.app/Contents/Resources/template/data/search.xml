        <text><![CDATA[READ ME FIRSTMost people want to live a healthy, balanced spiritual life, but few achieve this by themselves. And most small groups struggle to bal- ance all of God’s purposes in their meetings. Groups tend to over- emphasize one of the five purposes, perhaps fellowship or disciple- ship. Rarely is there a healthy balance that includes evangelism, ministry, and worship. That’s why we’ve included all of these elements in this study so you can live a healthy, balanced spiritual life over time.A typical group session will include the following:Memory VersesFor each session we have provided a memory verse that emphasizes an important truth from the session. This is an optional exercise, but we believe that memorizing Scripture can be a vital part of fill- ing our minds with God’s Word. We encourage you to give this important habit a try.CONNECTING with God’s Family (Fellowship)The foundation for spiritual growth is an intimate connection with God and his family. A few people who really know you and who earn your trust provide a place to experience the life Jesus invites you to live. This section of each session typically o ers you two activities. You can get to know your whole group by using the icebreaker ques- tion, and/or you can check in with one or two group members—your7]]></text>

A Deepening Life Together: Acts Video Teaching DVD companion to this study guide is available. For each study session, the DVD contains a lesson taught by Erik Thoennes. If you are using the DVD, you will view the teaching segment after your Connecting discussion and before your group discussion time (the Growing section). At the end of each session in this study guide, you will find space for your notes on the teaching segment.GROWING to Be Like Christ (Discipleship)Here is where you come face-to-face with Scripture. In core passages you’ll explore what the Bible teaches about the topic of the study. The focus won’t be on accumulating information but on how we should live in light of the Word of God. We want to help you apply the Scriptures practically, creatively, and from your heart as well as your head. At the end of the day, allowing the timeless truths from God’s Word to transform our lives in Christ is our greatest aim.DEVELOPING Your Gifts to Serve Others (Ministry)Jesus trained his disciples to discover and develop their gifts to serve others. And God has designed each of us uniquely to serve him in a way no other person can. This section will help you discover and use your God-given design. It will also encourage your group to discover your unique design as a community. In this study, you’ll put into practice what you’ve learned in the Bible study by taking a step to serve others. These simple steps will take your group on a faith journey that could change your lives forever.SHARING Your Life Mission Every Day (Evangelism)Many people skip over this aspect of the Christian life because it’sscary, relationally awkward, or simply too much work for their busy 8]]></text>

It could mean welcoming a few newcomers into your group, hosting a short-term group in your home, or walking through this study with a friend. In this study, you’ll have an op- portunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.SURRENDERING Your Life for God’s Pleasure (Worship)God is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will give you a chance to surrender your heart to God in prayer and worship. You may read a psalm together, share a page in your jour- nal, or sing a song to close your meeting. If you have never prayed aloud in a group before, no one will pressure you. Instead, you’ll experience the support of others who are praying for you.Study NotesThis section provides background notes on the Bible passage(s) you examine in the Growing section. You may want to refer to these notes during your group meeting or as a reference for those doing additional study.For Deeper Study (Optional)If you want to dig deeper into more Bible passages about the topic at hand, we’ve provided additional passages and questions. Your group may choose to do study homework ahead of each meeting in order to cover more biblical material. Or you as an individual may choose to study the For Deeper Study on your own. If you prefer not to do study homework, the Growing section will provide you with plenty to discuss within the group. These options allow individuals or the whole group to go deeper in their study, while still accommodating those who can’t do homework or are new to your group.9]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstYou can record your discoveries in your journal. We encourage you to read some of your insights to a friend (spiritual partner) for accountability and support. Spiritual partners may check in each week over the phone, through e-mail, or at the beginning of the group meeting.ReflectionsOn the Reflections pages we provide Scriptures to read and reflect on between group meetings. We suggest you use this section to seek God at home throughout the week. This time at home should begin and end with prayer. Don’t get in a hurry; take enough time to hear God’s direction.Subgroup for Discussion and PrayerIf your group is large (more than seven people), we encourage you to separate into groups of two to four for discussion and prayer. This is to encourage greater participation and deeper discussion.10]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[INTRODUCTIONWelcome to the Deepening Life Together Bible study on Acts. We will live this Bible study together during the next eight weeks as we experience God through the pages of Scripture in a mighty way, accomplishing his purpose for salvation. As we read, discuss, and reflect on the topic of each session together, our confidence in God’s ability to use ordinary people to accomplish his purposes will grow to new heights. We will discover and tap into the power that fueled Jesus’s commission to his disciples to take the gospel to the ends of the earth.The next eight weeks will take us step-by-step through the stages of the gospel expansion. We will witness the explosion of the gospel message as the Spirit-filled and Spirit-empowered believers boldly proclaimed the message of salvation everywhere they went. Met by internal conflict and external persecution, the church was strength- ened, forcing the gospel out of its Jerusalem confines. We’ll see how the dramatic conversion of Saul set the stage for the expansion of the church to the Gentiles, a critical first step in Jesus’s commission to take the gospel to all nations. In the climax and resolution to the study, we will learn that despite Paul’s persecution and imprisonment the gospel is not bound as he continues to boldly proclaim God’s good news, advancing it to the ends of the earth.This journey of discovery will make known God’s purposes for our lives. We will connect with our loving and faithful God and with other believers in small group community. We will become his hands11]]></text>

We will experience the closeness that he desires with us as we prayerfully respond to the principles we learn in this study and learn to place him first in our lives.We at Baker Books and Lifetogether Publishing look forward to hearing the stories of how God changes you from the inside out during this small group experience. We pray God blesses you with all he has planned for you through this journey together.For the Lord is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations.Psalm 100:5 (NIV)12]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[SESSION ONEBRILLIANT BEGINNINGSMemory Verse: But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the endsof the earth (Acts 1:8 NIV).Every morning before school for the past year or so, John’s daughter has faithfully made him a pot of co ee. He’s grown accustomed to going downstairs, reaching for a mug, and simply pouring a steaming hot cup. Once in awhile, though, the carafe is empty. Only a little disappointed, John realizes that his daughter forgot to push the but- ton to turn the co ee maker on. It’s amazing how much di erence power makes to a good cup of co ee.Charles Spurgeon said, “We might preach ’til our tongue rotted, ’til we exhaust our lungs and die—but never a soul would be con- verted unless the Holy Spirit uses the Word to convert that soul.”* Following Jesus’s ascension in chapter 1 of the book of Acts, the Holy Spirit fills the apostles, empowering them to be his witnesses. The apostles might have felt confident in their ability to minister, especially having learned under the master himself, but without the power of the Holy Spirit to touch hearts, they are empty carafes.* Peter Adam, Speaking God’s Words: A Practical Theology of Preaching (Vancouver: Regent College Publishing, 2004).13]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[ActsConnectingAs you begin Session One, ask the Lord in prayer to unify your group and challenge you as you study his Word during these next eight weeks.Take time to pass around a copy of the Small Group Roster in the appendix, a sheet of paper, or one of you pass your study guide, opened to the Small Group Roster. Each of you write down your contact information including the best time and method for contact- ing you. Then, someone volunteer to make copies or type up a list with everyone’s information and e-mail it to the group this week.1. Begin this first session of Acts by introducing yourselves. In- clude your name, what you do for a living, and what you do for fun. You may also include whether or not you are married, how long you have been married, how many children you have, and their ages.2. Whether your group is new or ongoing, it’s always important to reflect on and review your values together. In the Appendix is a Small Group Agreement with the values most useful in sustaining healthy, balanced groups. Choose two or three values that you have room to grow in, or haven’t previously focused on, to emphasize during this study. Doing this will take your group to the next stage of intimacy and spiritual health.If your group is new, you may want to focus on welcom- ing newcomers or on sharing group ownership. Any group will quickly move from being the leader’s group to our group if everyone understands the goals of the group and shares a small role. See the Team Roles in the Appendix for help on how to do this well.3. Share your expectations for the study. How do you hope God will challenge you?14]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Brilliant BeginningsGrowingThe early days of the church described in Acts were a time of ex- traordinary unity, growth, and expansion, as the Spirit-filled and Spirit-empowered believers boldly proclaimed the message of salva- tion to the residents of Jerusalem.4. Read Acts 1:1–11. What are the key elements of Jesus’s commis- sion to his disciples (1:8)? Why is each element important?What point were the two men dressed in white (v. 11) trying to get across? How does this apply to believers today?5. Jesus instructed his disciples to stay in Jerusalem until the promised gift was given (vv. 4–5). What was the gift Jesus spoke about?6. Read Acts 1:15–26, which tells us what the disciples did as they waited. They replaced Judas because it was symbolically important to have twelve apostles. If you know anything about the Old Testament, what did the number twelve signify?7. Read Acts 2. What e ect did the demonstration of the power of the Holy Spirit (2:1–4) have on the Jews who were present (2:5–13)?Verses 14–26 summarize Peter’s first proclamation of the gos- pel. What are the central historical facts of his message (vv. 22–24, 32–33)?Why is the bodily resurrection of Jesus from the dead, as a historical event that really happened, central to Peter’s message? According to Peter, what does the resurrection demonstrate?8. Two gifts were given in Acts 2:37–41: forgiveness of sins and the Holy Spirit. To whom was the Spirit given and how did they receive it? (See the Study Notes for more information about Filled with the Spirit vs. Baptism of the Spirit.)15]]></text>

Why was each of these important?What e ect did this have on the growth in number of believers? Discuss the implication of this on the church today.10. Peter healed a lame beggar and continued to preach in the power of the Spirit (chap. 3), despite the danger of arrest and death (chap. 4). Read Acts 4:4, and reread Acts 2:41. What do we learn about the power of the Holy Spirit through the people’s responses to Peter’s message?11. What are the noteworthy elements of the believers’ prayer (4:23–31) after Peter and John were arrested and eventually freed?What was the result of this prayer?12. Considering question 8 and the events of Acts 2–4, how can you conclude that one becomes and remains Spirit-filled? (See the Study Notes for information about Filled with the Spirit vs. Baptism of the Spirit.)13. What did Gamaliel say in Acts 5:38–39? How was it prophetic of what was to come?14. When has the Holy Spirit enabled you to act boldly? If you can’t think of a time, what might that mean?The Holy Spirit empowered the apostles to preach the gospel boldly in spite of opposition, and thousands were added to the num- ber of believers.16]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Brilliant BeginningsDevelopingAs we discovered in this session, the Holy Spirit enables believers to minister with confidence. Developing our ability to serve God according to the Holy Spirit’s leading requires that we get to know God personally and intimately. We must make time for prayer, for reading God’s Word, and for meditation, and invite the Holy Spirit to speak into our lives every day.15. Which of the following steps are you willing to take for the next few weeks?t Prayer. Commit to daily time in personal, focused prayer and connection with God. Find a place where you can be alone and undistracted. You may find it helpful to write your prayers in a journal.t Reflection.Attheendofeachsession,you’llfindReflections— Scriptures that specifically relate to the topic of our study each week. These are provided to give you an opportunity for reading a short Bible passage five days a week during the course of this study. Write down your insights on what you read each day in the space provided. On the sixth day, summarize what God has shown you throughout the week.t Meditation. Meditation is focused attention on the Word of God—a great way to internalize God’s Word more deeply. Copy a portion of Scripture on a card and tape it somewhere in your line of sight, such as your car’s dashboard, the bath- room mirror, or the kitchen table. Think about it when you sit at red lights, while you get ready for your day, or while you’re eating a meal. Reflect on what God is saying to you through these words. Consider using the memory verse and Reflections verses provided each week for meditation.17]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[ActsSharingJesus commissioned all of his disciples to be his witnesses (Acts 1:8, memory verse), but he does not expect us to do it alone. As this verse tells us, we will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on us. The Holy Spirit will enable us to confidently share Jesus with others.16. Acts 4:13 says, “When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus” (NIV).Can anyone tell by your life that you’ve been with Jesus? Talk about what people see in a Christian’s life that reveals Jesus.17. During the coming week, note the people with whom you interact in your daily life. Are there people that you see casu- ally every day, meet socially with once per week, or talk to with regularity? These are just some of the people that make up your sphere of influence or “circle of life.” Next week we will take a closer look at who these people are and how Jesus might be calling you to boldly share with them.SurrenderingWorship means to show reverent love and devotion to God. Each week you will have an opportunity to surrender your hearts to God in an attitude of worship through vocal praise and prayer.18. Every believer should have a plan for spending time alone with God. Your time with God is individual and reflects who you are in relationship with our personal God. However you choose to spend your time with him, try to allow time for praise, prayer, and reading of Scripture. The Reflections provided in each ses- sion can be used in your daily time with him. These will o er reinforcement of the principles we are learning, and help you18]]></text>

Allow everyone to answer this question: “How can we pray for you this week?” Write prayer requests on your Prayer and Praise Report and commit to praying for each other throughout the week.Before We Meet AgainIn Session Two, we will be discussing Acts chapters 6 through 8. Although questions will target specific passages, it is important that you understand the context of the passages we will be studying. With this in mind, read these chapters before meeting for Session Two.Study NotesFilled with the Spirit vs. Baptism of the Spirit: Though some Chris- tians di er in their perspective on this issue, being filled with the Spirit appears to be di erent from being baptized by the Spirit. The apostle Paul speaks of being baptized into Christ and receiving the Spirit as one event by which Christ places believers into his body (Rom. 6:4–6; 8:9–16; 1 Cor. 12:3, 13; Gal. 3:1–5, 26–28; 4:4–7). No- where in his letters does he seem to imagine a person who has put faith in Christ but who has not received the Spirit. (However, see Acts 8:15–16.)Being filled with the Spirit, on the other hand, appears to be an ongoing experience of dependence on the Holy Spirit’s power to live righteously. Although filled initially on the Day of Pentecost, Peter was filled again in Acts 4:8. Many of the same people filled with the Spirit in Acts 2 were filled again in Acts 4:31. Acts 6:5 describes Stephen as a man “full of faith and of the Holy Spirit,” yet Acts 7:55 records his being filled again. Paul was filled with the Spirit in Acts 9:17 and again in Acts 13:9.19]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[ActsPentecost: The fiftieth day after the Sabbath of Passover week (Lev. 23:15–16), thus the first day of the week. Pentecost is also called the Feast of Weeks (Deut. 16:10), the Feast of Harvest (Exod. 23:16), and the day of firstfruits (Num. 28:26).Pharisees: The Pharisees were a religious party within Judaism who strictly kept the law of Moses and the unwritten “tradition of the elders.” They were strong competitors and opponents of the Sadducees.Sadducees: A Jewish sect whose members came from the priestly line and controlled the temple. They did not believe in the resurrection or a personal Messiah, but held that the messianic age—an ideal time—was then present and must be preserved. The high priest of the Sadducees presided over the Sanhedrin.Sanhedrin: The supreme Jewish court. In New Testament times, it was made up of three kinds of members: chief priests, elders, and teachers of the law. Its total membership numbered seventy-one, including the high priest, who was presiding o cer. Under Roman jurisdiction, the Sanhedrin was given a great deal of authority, but they could not impose capital punishment.For Deeper Study (Optional)In Acts 1:8, Jesus tells us that we will be his witnesses. In a court of law, a witness is a person who gives a testimony. The apostles had been with Jesus during his entire three years of ministry.1. After three years with Jesus, what could they testify about him?2. Read John 9:1–25. What was the blind man’s testimony (see v. 25)? What insight does this passage give into your own testimony?20]]></text>

How does this passage bring clarity to Acts 1:8?ReflectionsReading, reflecting, and meditating on the Word of God is essential to getting to know him deeply. As you read the verses each day, give prayerful consideration to what you learn about God, his Spirit, and his place in your life. Then record your thoughts, insights, or prayer in the Reflect section below the verses you read. On the sixth day, record a summary of what you learned over the entire week through this study.Day 1. When the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, he will testify about me.

A “get to know you” co ee, dinner, or dessert is a great way to launch a new study. You may want to review the Small Group Agreement and share the names of a few friends you can invite to join you. But most importantly, have fun before your study time begins.Where do we find new members for our group?This can be challenging, especially for new groups that have only a fewpeopleorforexistinggroupsthatloseafewpeoplealongtheway. We encourage you to pray with your group and then brainstorm a list of people from work, church, your neighborhood, your children’s school, family, the gym, and so forth. Then have each group member invite several of the people on his or her list. Another good strategy is to ask church leaders to make an announcement that your group is open to new members.No matter how you find members, it’s vital that you stay on the lookout for new people to join your group. All groups tend to go through healthy attrition—the result of moves, releasing new lead- ers, ministry opportunities, and so forth—and if the group gets too85]]></text>

The next person just might become a friend for life. You never know!How long will this group meet?It’s totally up to the group—once you come to the end of this study. Most groups meet weekly for at least their first six months together, but every other week can work as well. We strongly recommend that the group meet for the first six months on a weekly basis if at all possible. This allows for continuity, and if people miss a meeting they aren’t gone for a whole month.At the end of this study, each group member may decide whether heorshewantstocontinueonforanotherstudy.Somegroupslaunch relationships that last for years, and others are stepping-stones into another group experience. Either way, enjoy the journey.What if this group is not working for me?Personality conflicts, life stage di erences, geographical distance, level of spiritual maturity, or any number of things can cause you to feel the group doesn’t work for you. Relax. Pray for God’s direction, and at the end of this study decide whether to continue with this group or find another. You don’t buy the first car you look at or marry the first person you date, and the same goes with a group. Don’t bail out before the study is finished—God might have something to teach you. Also, don’t run from conflict or prejudge people before you have given them a chance. God is still working in you too!Who is the leader?Most groups have an o cial leader. But ideally, the group will ma- ture and members will share the facilitation of meetings. We have discovered that healthy groups share hosting and leading of the group. This model ensures that all members grow, give their unique contribution, and develop their gifts. This study guide and the Holy Spirit can keep things on track even when you share leadership. Christ has promised to be in your midst as you gather. Ultimately, God is your leader each step of the way.86]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Frequently Asked QuestionsHow do we handle the child care needs in our group?This can be a sensitive issue. We suggest that you empower the group to openly brainstorm solutions. You may try one option that works for a while and then adjust over time. Our favorite approach is for adults to meet in the living room or dining room, and share the cost of a babysitter (or two) who can be with the kids in a di erent part of the house. In this way, parents don’t have to be away from their children all evening when their children are too young to be left at home. A second option is to use one home for the kids and a second home (close by) for the adults. A third idea is to rotate the responsi- bility of providing a lesson or care for the children either in the same home or in another home nearby. This can be an incredible blessing for kids. Finally, the most common idea is to decide that you need to have a night to invest in your spiritual lives individually or as a couple, and make your own arrangements for child care. No mat- ter what decision the group makes, the best approach is to dialogue openly about both the problem and the solution.87]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Session One Brilliant BeginningsConnecting1. We’ve designed this study for both new and established groups, and for both seekers and the spiritually mature. New groups will need to invest more time building relationships with each other. Established groups often want to dig deeper into Bible study and application. Regardless of whether your group is new or has been together for a while, be sure to answer this introductory question at this first session.2. A very important item in this first session is the Small Group Agreement. An agreement helps clarify your group’s priorities and cast new vision for what the group can become. You can find this in the Appendix of this study guide. We’ve found that groups that talk about these values up front and commit to an agreement benefit significantly. They work through conflicts long before people get to the point of frustration, so there’s a lot less pain.Take some time to review this agreement before your meeting. Then during your meeting, read the agreement aloud to the entire group. If some people have concerns about a specific item or the agreement as a whole, be sensitive to their concerns. Explain that tens of thousands of groups use agreements like this one as a simple tool for building trust and group health over time.We recommend talking about shared ownership of the group. It’s impor- tant that each member have a role. See the Appendix to learn more about Team Roles. This is a great tool to get this important practice launched in your group.If your group is new, you may want to focus on welcoming newcomers or on sharing group ownership. Any group will quickly move from being the leader’s group to our group if everyone understands the goals of the127LEADER’S NOTESSESSIONS]]></text>

It’s a good idea to ask ahead of time, because not everyone is comfortable reading aloud in public.4. The disciples will be witnesses—first locally and eventually globally— testifying to the events of Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection. They will receive power to fulfill this mission when the Holy Spirit comes on them. The mission, its content and scope, and the source of the power to fulfill it are all key.The disciples should not just stand around looking up into the sky as though they are losing Jesus; they are to set about the mandate that Jesus gave them because no one knows the day or time that he will return. Believ- ers today should also serve Christ while awaiting his return. The two men dressed in white were basically saying, “Don’t just stand around reminiscing about what was; get busy!”5. The promised gift was the empowering infilling of the Holy Spirit.6. Peter used Scripture (Psalm 55:12–15) as a basis for replacing Judas Iscariot. By choosing twelve disciples, Jesus was symbolically replicating the twelve tribes of Israel. His twelve apostles symbolized the nation Israel, the faithful remnant of God’s people.7. The Jews were bewildered and amazed. Some questioned this demonstration of the power of the Holy Spirit, while others made fun of the disciples at- tributing their display to drunkenness.The resurrection is the evidence that Jesus is the Messiah promised in the Old Testament. If Jesus wasn’t raised from the dead, then he was merely one of thousands of men crucified as criminals by the Romans. Lots of people saw Jesus before his death. The apostles were the witnesses who saw him alive after his death. This was an astounding claim to make, but the Holy Spirit’s power backed up Peter’s assertion.8. The indwelling gift of the Spirit was and still is available to all who profess faith in Christ. People receive the Spirit at the moment of conversion.9. The early church was devoted to the apostles’ teaching, fellowship, breaking bread, prayer, and meeting the needs of the community. The teaching fed them with accurate knowledge of what Jesus did and taught, and what his death and resurrection meant. Fellowship went deeper than socializing—it fed the soul with shared life on an intimate and practical level. The breaking of bread involved shared meals that fed bodies and also the Lord’s Supper,128]]></text>

    <page pageNumber="42">
        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s Noteswhich fed believers with a constant reminder of what Christ’s broken body had done for them. Prayer taught them to talk and listen to God.10. It is the power of the Holy Spirit that convicts souls and provokes belief.11. The believers a rmed God’s sovereign power in the face of the govern- ment’s power. They petitioned the Lord for miraculous signs and wonders and for boldness in speaking his Word. After they prayed, the place they were praying in was shaken, they were filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the Word of God boldly.12. One receives the indwelling Spirit at conversion, one is continually filled with the Spirit, as Peter and John and the other believers were, by living consciously in the Lord’s presence and allowing his Word and Spirit to dominate every aspect of our lives. Remaining filled with the Spirit (also referred to as walking in the Spirit) happens as we continually pursue godli- ness and righteous living, depending on his power to enable us.13. Gamaliel said that if the apostles’ activity was of human origin, then it would fail on its own, without influence of the Sanhedrin. If, however, the apostles’ work was of God, then the Sanhedrin were powerless to stop them.DevelopingThis section enables you to help the group see the importance of devel- oping their abilities for service to God.15. The intent of this discussion is to encourage group members to set aside some time to spend with God in prayer and his Word at home each day throughout the week. Read through this section and be prepared to help the group understand how important it is to fill our minds with the Word of God. If people already have a commitment to a good Bible reading plan, that is great, but you may have people who struggle to stay in the Word daily. Sometimes beginning with a simple commitment to a short daily reading can start a habit that changes their life.The Reflections pages at the end of each session include verses that were either talked about in the session or support the teaching of the session. They are very short readings with a few lines to encourage people to write down their thoughts. Remind the group about these Reflections each week during the Surrendering section. Encourage the group to see the importance of making this time to connect with God a priority in their life. O er fur- ther encouragement to commit to a next step in prayer, Bible reading, or meditation on the Word.Suggested exercise: To help the group get started with meditating on the Word of God, provide everyone with a 3 × 5 index card. Have everyone129]]></text>

Each group session will provide group members a chance to surrender their hearts to God in prayer and worship. Group prayer requests and prayer time should be included every week.18. Encourage group members to use the Reflections verses in their daily quiet time throughout the week. This will move them closer to God while rein- forcing the lesson of this session through related Scripture.19. As you move to a time of sharing prayer requests, be sure to remind the group of the importance of confidentiality and keeping what is shared in the group within the group. Everyone must feel that the personal things they share will be kept in confidence if you are to have safety and bonding among the group members.Session Two Opposition and ExpansionConnecting2. We encourage the group to rotate leaders and host homes each meeting. This practice will go a long way toward bonding the group. Review the Small Group Calendar and talk about who else is willing to open their home or facilitate a meeting. Rotating host homes and leadership along with implementing Team Roles as discussed in Session One will quickly move the group ownership from “the leader’s group” to “our group.”Growing4. There were two groups of Jews who made up the church at this point: the Greek-speaking (Hellenistic) Jews and the Hebrew or Aramaic-speaking Jews (see Study Notes). The Greek Jewish widows felt that they were not receiving an adequate share of the food that the church provided for their care. The apostles chose seven men from among the Greek Jews to fairly represent the Greeks’ interests.The apostles’ choosing of seven men from among the Greek Jews was a demonstration of love and unity. The apostles wanted the Greek Jews to feel their interests were represented fairly. Since the a airs of the church were in order, the apostles could then focus on the ministry of the gospel.130]]></text>
