<noscript> Leader’s Noteswhich fed believers with a constant reminder of what Christ’s broken body had done for them. Prayer taught them to talk and listen to God.10. It is the power of the Holy Spirit that convicts souls and provokes belief.11. The believers a rmed God’s sovereign power in the face of the govern- ment’s power. They petitioned the Lord for miraculous signs and wonders and for boldness in speaking his Word. After they prayed, the place they were praying in was shaken, they were filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the Word of God boldly.12. One receives the indwelling Spirit at conversion, one is continually filled with the Spirit, as Peter and John and the other believers were, by living consciously in the Lord’s presence and allowing his Word and Spirit to dominate every aspect of our lives. Remaining filled with the Spirit (also referred to as walking in the Spirit) happens as we continually pursue godli- ness and righteous living, depending on his power to enable us.13. Gamaliel said that if the apostles’ activity was of human origin, then it would fail on its own, without influence of the Sanhedrin. If, however, the apostles’ work was of God, then the Sanhedrin were powerless to stop them.DevelopingThis section enables you to help the group see the importance of devel- oping their abilities for service to God.15. The intent of this discussion is to encourage group members to set aside some time to spend with God in prayer and his Word at home each day throughout the week. Read through this section and be prepared to help the group understand how important it is to fill our minds with the Word of God. If people already have a commitment to a good Bible reading plan, that is great, but you may have people who struggle to stay in the Word daily. Sometimes beginning with a simple commitment to a short daily reading can start a habit that changes their life.The Reflections pages at the end of each session include verses that were either talked about in the session or support the teaching of the session. They are very short readings with a few lines to encourage people to write down their thoughts. Remind the group about these Reflections each week during the Surrendering section. Encourage the group to see the importance of making this time to connect with God a priority in their life. O er fur- ther encouragement to commit to a next step in prayer, Bible reading, or meditation on the Word.Suggested exercise: To help the group get started with meditating on the Word of God, provide everyone with a 3 × 5 index card. Have everyone129 </noscript>
