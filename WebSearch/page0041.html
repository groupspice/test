<noscript> Leader’s Notesgroup and shares a small role. See the Team Roles in the Appendix for help on how to do this well.GrowingHave someone read Bible passages aloud. It’s a good idea to ask ahead of time, because not everyone is comfortable reading aloud in public.4. The disciples will be witnesses—first locally and eventually globally— testifying to the events of Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection. They will receive power to fulfill this mission when the Holy Spirit comes on them. The mission, its content and scope, and the source of the power to fulfill it are all key.The disciples should not just stand around looking up into the sky as though they are losing Jesus; they are to set about the mandate that Jesus gave them because no one knows the day or time that he will return. Believ- ers today should also serve Christ while awaiting his return. The two men dressed in white were basically saying, “Don’t just stand around reminiscing about what was; get busy!”5. The promised gift was the empowering infilling of the Holy Spirit.6. Peter used Scripture (Psalm 55:12–15) as a basis for replacing Judas Iscariot. By choosing twelve disciples, Jesus was symbolically replicating the twelve tribes of Israel. His twelve apostles symbolized the nation Israel, the faithful remnant of God’s people.7. The Jews were bewildered and amazed. Some questioned this demonstration of the power of the Holy Spirit, while others made fun of the disciples at- tributing their display to drunkenness.The resurrection is the evidence that Jesus is the Messiah promised in the Old Testament. If Jesus wasn’t raised from the dead, then he was merely one of thousands of men crucified as criminals by the Romans. Lots of people saw Jesus before his death. The apostles were the witnesses who saw him alive after his death. This was an astounding claim to make, but the Holy Spirit’s power backed up Peter’s assertion.8. The indwelling gift of the Spirit was and still is available to all who profess faith in Christ. People receive the Spirit at the moment of conversion.9. The early church was devoted to the apostles’ teaching, fellowship, breaking bread, prayer, and meeting the needs of the community. The teaching fed them with accurate knowledge of what Jesus did and taught, and what his death and resurrection meant. Fellowship went deeper than socializing—it fed the soul with shared life on an intimate and practical level. The breaking of bread involved shared meals that fed bodies and also the Lord’s Supper,128 </noscript>
